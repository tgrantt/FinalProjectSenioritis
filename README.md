#Final Project
Group Project Outline:
This project aims to create a model which predicts the price of an airline ticket from a particular chosen airport to various destinations within the United States. To do this we plan to do the following:
      1. Use the FlightScanner and Hipmunk api's to get data on ticket price and distance for various carriers travelling from LAX tovarious         	locations in the U.S. To keep the data sets manageable, we will choose 50 different flights coming out of LAX and find the  prices for         
	those flights every week beginning January 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020.
      2. Once we cleaned our data set, we will run different regression models on the data set. We will then procede to choose the best model       
	based on RMSE and accuracy scores.
